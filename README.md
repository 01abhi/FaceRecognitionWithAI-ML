# Face recognition Flask App using Machine learning pipeline model

![Alt text](sample_prediction.png?raw=true "Prediction Results")

The Facial Recognition Flask App to identify gender from images and videos using Machine Learning model to classify the images, between Male and Female. 
The project uses SVM, Numpy,Pandas , Matplotlib , PIL , CV2 , Sci-kit Learn. 

The dependecies can be downloaded as follows-
To install flask

>pip install Flask

To Install all other dependencies

> pip install scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, opencv-python

To run the Flask app:
> python3 main.py

## Important details of the dataset
The dataset used here for training is from : 
https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/

The used one here is of faces only and can be directly downloaded from the link below:

## Jupyter Notebooks
The notebook folder contains two jupyter notebook. 
1. Face recognition using Machine learning has all the steps leading to pipeline model creation. 
2. Pipeline model file could be independently used to predict gender in from the images or video.
